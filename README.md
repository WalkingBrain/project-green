# Project Green

Project of me and my friends originally started a year ago by me when I started coding, then forgotten. And in the last month I've returned to it, made the code for the engine twice as long, finally made a basic script of the game and built a four-person team around it consisting of my friends/classmates.

The game is meant to be played by my classmates, but doesn't use any inside jokes so it will be fun even for normal people
If you want just the engine it is at https://github.com/WalkingBrain/text-based-game-engine but I don't update it that frequently, adn the same version is going to be here
